## Motivation and Purpose
Homicides in the United States is an important topic to think about. Compared to other high-income countries, the US contains greater homicide rates (e.g. gun homicides, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30817955/). Because homicides can cause significant negative effects (e.g. loss of life), it may be important to investigate ways to reduce the negative effects of homicides.


One way to address the negative effects of homicides in the US may be to provide general education about homicides. General education can be helpful in at least two ways: 1) For everyday citizens, awareness about homicides (e.g. what types of crimes are likely to be committed, in which regions), may increase citizens’ abilities to prepare and defend themselves against attacks. 2) For people working in crime-related areas (e.g. law enforcement), information about homicides may increase their ability to pinpoint and reduce criminal activity.

Therefore, the aim of the current project is to create tools that could provide education about homicides in the US. Specifically, we will create an interactive dashboard investigating homicide-related data from the 2000’s to 2014s. This dashboard could be used to provide insights into relevant questions, such as examining how homicide-related activity is distributed geographically across the US.

## Research questions and usage scenarios

More specifically, the dashboard aims to provide insights into the five following areas:

1) How is homicide activity (that is, the number of counts of homicides) distributed geographically across the United States?

2) What are the characteristics of homicide activity across geographical regions? (e.g., examining how time of homicide activity, racial characteristics of homicide activity, type of homicide activity, differs across geographical regions).

3) Is homicide related activity related to time period of the year (e.g. does homicide frequency differ across seasons)?

4) How does homicidal activity typically play out? For example, examining whether certain racial groups are more or less likely to commit homicides against other racial groups.

5) How has homicide activity changed over time? 

As mentioned in the introduction, answering these questions could be helpful in reducing criminal activities because it can 1) educate people in the US, such as travellers and citizens (e.g., increasing awareness to prepare and defend against homicides), and 2) can educate people working in crime related areas (e.g. providing a detailed and flexible aggregate overview of homicides for law enforcement to pinpoint and reduce crime).

## Description of the data

To answer our research questions, we will be visualizing the Homicide Reports dataset from 2010-2014 which has approximately 73000 instances of reported homicides. 

Each instance has 20 associated variables to be showed in the dashboard, each highlighting different aspects of crime to better understand trends in homicide. These include: 
1) the location and time of the homicide report (`City`,`State`,`Year`,`Month`)

2) the instance number of each record (`Incident`)

3) the method and information of the crime (`Crime Type`, `Crime Solved`, `Weapon`)

4) all of the information of the victim and perpetrator (`Victim Sex`, `Victim Age`, `Victim Race`, `Victim Ethnicity`, `Perpetrator Sex`, 
`Perpetrator Age`, `Perpetrator Race`, `Perpetrator Ethnicity`, `Relationship`).
