# Features Implemented
Our dashboard is spread across 2 tabs of content.

## Tab 1
* Shows count of homicides in the US by States, and presents the data according to the gender of the victim and the perpetrator
* Can filter the count of homicides across year values and weapon type values
* By selecting a state, shows line chart and bar chart about counts of homicides by month and by perpetrator race

## Tab 2


# Features To Improve On

## Tab 1
* Beautification of slider and checkbox 
* Add `select all` in checkbox to select all weapon type valus 
* Add a relatively good level of interactivity that selecting different continents in map graph can change all three graphs


## Tab 2


## Tab1 & Tab2
* Unify and beautify page style

# Features Not Yet Implemented
* Did not yet add Sankey graph to visualize distribution of attacker-victim relationships.
